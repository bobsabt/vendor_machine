## VendorMachine project

Vendor machine displays the available products and their price. Just put enough coins in the machine and choose the desired product. If you change your mind during the process, you can refund your money anytime. In this case, below the Change you can see the amount of refunded money in 20, 10, 5 value coins. In case of a successful purchase, you can also see the retrieved money under the Change and the selected item, at the bottom left of the vending machine slot. If you misspell the product code, you just need to push the Clear button, and enter the right code. 

This project was created with React, TypeScript and MaterialUI.
